// Step 1: define a vairable that stores the number of cups that a person has consumed
//Step 2: use an if else statement
//if the person has had less than 3 cups, log "Yes, I'll take another cup."
//else log a message that states, "I think I'm ok for now."
//Step 3: use console.log() to log a message to the console with the rest

var cups = 1;

if (cups < 3) {
	console.log("Yes, I'll take another cup of coffe.");
} else {
	console.log("I think I'm ok for now.")
